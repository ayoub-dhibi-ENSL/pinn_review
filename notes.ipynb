    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "When enough data is available neural networks (NNs) have proven very efficient at solving machine learning problems such as natural language processing, image recognition etc. However in many applications the data is scarce and difficult to obtain (complex physical systems, biological systems, etc), with few data, current state-of-the art NNs are less accurate and may not even converge to a proper solution of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current approach to solve these complex systems problems do not use all the information available to constraint the solutions. Typically one feeds a neural network (NN) with data pairs of training and target points and trains the NN by minimizing some error criterion with a potential regularization the loss and regularization term are chosen heuristically. When we have a prior knowledge of the system and the physical laws governing it a better approach is to encode directly the physical constraints into the regularization. The resulting model, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) display better convergences guarantees and better generalization even with few data points available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous work on physics-informed models used Gaussian process regression to solve linear problems. They got good approximations and theoretical error boundaries on different linear problems from mathematical physics. Further works extended the method to non linear problems by using the method on local linear approximations of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Problem setup and summary of contributions\n",
    "In the article, they use deep neural networks (DNNs) as universal function approximators extending naturally the class of problems solvable to non linear settings. They also use [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) to compute efficiently the partial derivatives. Then a constraint is added to the neural network so that the approximated function is solution to the non linear partial differential equations (PDEs) ruling the problem these equations encode all the physical laws characteristic of the system (conservation principles, symmetries, etc). This new approach lead to a new class of numerical solvers for PDEs and data-driven model inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new approach can be used to tackle two types of problems,\n",
    "1. data-driven solution: given noisy measurements find a function that is solution to the PDE \n",
    "2. data-driven discovery: given noisy measurements find the parameters of the PDE such that its solution(s) could have produced the measurements\n",
    "We can frame these as follow, lets consider parametrized non linear partial differential equations of the general form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\partial_t u(t,x) + N[u;\\lambda] = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $u(t,x)$ is the solution of the PDE and $N[.;\\lambda]$ is a non linear operator parametrized by $\\lambda$.\n",
    "Let us introduce the following notations of subscripts as partial derivatives:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\partial_t u = u_t \\text{, } \\partial_x u = u_x \\text{, } \\partial_x^2 u = u_{xx} \\text{, etc}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "has $N[u;\\lambda] = \\lambda_1 uu_x - \\lambda_2 uu_x$ with $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$.\n",
    "The two types of problems we outlined can now be reframed as:\n",
    "1. data-driven solution: given noisy measurements and fixed parameters $\\lambda$ what can be said about $u$\n",
    "2. data-driven discovery: given noisy measurements and assuming they come from a solution of the equation, what are the most likely parameters $\\lambda$ ruling the equation\n",

    "### 2. Continuous Time Models\n",
    "A deep neural network is used to approximate a solution of the PDE. If the network is deep enough it is an universal approximator i.e. it can approximate any function one will ever encounter (except very pathological examples) [ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0893608089900208). We denote the neural network as $u^\\theta$ where $\\theta$ represents the parameters of the neural network. Finally we define the *physics informed neural network*\n",

    "\n",
    "If the PDE problem is well posed, the boundary and limit conditions along are enough to determine an unique solution. Moreover, typical PDE solvers (based on other methods e.g. finite differences) also use only boundary and limit data. However there is no theoretical convergence guarantee. But the empirical results shows that with a deep enough neural network and with enough collocation points $N_f$, the approximated solution achieves good prediction accuracy.\n",
